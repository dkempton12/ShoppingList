# shopping-list
Grocery list app built with jQuery, Javascript, and CSS3. The app allows the user to append items, as well as clear one item at a time, or the list as a whole. Keydown functions were programmed for the buttons. For the design, I went with a transparent container div, and a farm-to-table background image, so to speak.
